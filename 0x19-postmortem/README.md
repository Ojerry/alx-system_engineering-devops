Preventive Measures:

To prevent future outages, we will take the following preventive measures:

Implement regular maintenance and monitoring of our database servers to ensure that hardware failures are detected and resolved before they can cause an outage.
Implement a backup and disaster recovery plan to ensure that we can quickly and effectively restore service in the event of a future outage.
Implement automated alerts and notifications to notify our team of any potential issues with our database servers.
Corrective Measures:

To correct the issue that caused the outage, we will take the following corrective measures:

Replace the faulty hardware on the primary database server to prevent future failures.
